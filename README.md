## 🧩 Core Components

Key components that drive the application's functionality:

### `SkipCard.tsx`

Represents an individual skip option, displaying its details and handling selection.

```typescript
interface SkipCardProps {
  skip: Skip;
  isSelected: boolean;
  onSelect: (skip: Skip) => void;
}

const SkipCard: React.FC<SkipCardProps> = ({ skip, isSelected, onSelect }) => {
  // Component implementation...
};
```

### `SkipSelector.tsx`

The main container component responsible for fetching, displaying, and managing the selection of skip sizes.

```typescript
const [skips, setSkips] = useState<Skip[]>([]);
const [selectedSkip, setSelectedSkip] = useState<Skip | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  const loadSkips = async () => {
    try {
      const data = await fetchSkips();
      setSkips(data);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Failed to load skips:", err);
      // Implement user-friendly error handling here
    }
  };
  loadSkips();
}, []);
```

-----

## 🎨 Design System

The application's visual consistency is maintained through a defined color palette:

### Color Palette (`theme.ts`)

```typescript
export const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#2E7D32',       // Main green (e.g., buttons, accents)
    primaryDark: '#1B5E20',    // Darker green for hover/active states
    secondary: '#FFA000',     // Accent orange (e.g., highlights)
    background: '#F5F5F6',     // Light gray for overall page background
    surface: '#FFFFFF',        // White for cards and elevated elements
    text: '#263238',           // Dark text for primary content
    textSecondary: '#607D8B'   // Lighter text for secondary information
  }
};
```

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

Ready to deploy your Skip Size Selector? Here are the recommended steps:

### 1\. Prepare for Production

First, build the optimized production version of your application:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the application into the `build` folder, ready for deployment.

### 2\. Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel offers an incredibly simple and fast deployment experience:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally (if you haven't already)
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy your project to production
vercel --prod
```

### 3\. Alternative: Netlify

Netlify is another excellent option for deploying your front-end projects:

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally (if you haven't already)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy your project to production
netlify deploy --prod
```

## 💡 Enhancement Ideas

We're always looking for ways to improve\! Here are a few ideas for future enhancements:

1.  **Saved Selections**: Implement local storage to remember a user's recently selected skip sizes.
2.  **Comparison Tool**: Allow users to compare different skip sizes side-by-side to aid in decision-making.
3.  **AR Preview**: Integrate Augmented Reality (AR) to let users visualize the skip in their actual space.
4.  **Price Alerts**: Notify users about price changes or discounts on their preferred skip sizes.
5.  **Carbon Calculator**: Provide an estimate of the environmental impact (carbon footprint) associated with each skip size.
